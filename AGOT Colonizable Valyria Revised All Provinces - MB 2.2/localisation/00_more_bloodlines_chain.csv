EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.1;I am a skinchanger, and I claim the bear as my second skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.3;I am no beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.4;I have been having vivid dreams of late, dreams of the leaf and stone, dreams of what is past and what may yet be to come. Could these dreams have meaning? My bloodline is strong with the ancient blood of the First Men, the ancient folk who communed with the children of the Forest, could these dreams be messages from the Old Gods themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.4;I embrace the Old God’s Gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.4;Best not to dwell upon dreams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.5;You bear the blood of many a legendary hunter, and the thrill of the chase as you stalk your prey has always held an appeal for you. Do you embrace the calling of your ancestors and become a committed huntsman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.5;Hunting is in my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.5;Hunting bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.6;Your bloodline has long been associated with sorcery, mysticism and fell magics. Do you seek to emulate your ancestors and learn the arcane secrets?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.6;I shall seek out the secrets of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.6;I am not some woods-witch or hedge wizard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.7;Some men say you have black blood, and certainly many of your ancestors have committed foul and unspeakable deeds. Of late you have become more and more tempted to follow in their footsteps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.7;I am better than the dirt I spring from!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.8;The Fowler sigil is a falcon, their words are "Let Me Soar" and often as you ride you think of the joys an interest in falconry could bring. Maybe it is your Fowler blood calling to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.8;I must get myself a bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.8;There are better uses of my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.9;The Blackmont sigil is a great vulture and your legendary ancestor King Benedict Blackmont was said to have the power to transform himself into a vulture of enormous size. Now a great vulture perches before you, its eyes seeming to pierce your very soul, as if it recognises you. Are the stories true? Were the Blackmonts of old skinchangers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.9;Blackmont blood flows in my veins, this vulture is my second skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.9;I’ll have no part of this sorcery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.10;King Robert Baratheon was a mighty man with prodigious appetites, and his lust was chief amongst them. Lately you have begun to wonder if you might take after him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.10;Why must desire be a sin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.10;There is virtue in restraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.11;Queen Danaerys Stormborn felt that slavery was a cruel injustice to be stamped out wherever possible. You bear her blood, will you follow her example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.11;I must break the chains wherever I find them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.11;It is not my problem to solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.12;Some men say you have black blood, and many of your ancestors have had reputations for being ruled by their anger. Of late you have found yourself become more and more prone to violent outburst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.12;Anger is in my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.12;I will think calm thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.13;Many of your ancestors have been known for their great beauty, it seems that though not evident at your birth you take after your forebears and you have grown quite beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.13;I have become rather comely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.14;Not for nothing is the Stark sigil a direwolf: you have long had vivid dreams of being some great beast of the forest stalking its prey at the head of a mighty pack, now to your amazement a direwolf has emerged from the woods. Thought extinct south of the Wall it seems strangely docile and seems to be seeking you out, almost as if it recognises you…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.16;My ancestor Robb Stark was a skilled tactician who whilst little more than a child smashed the armies of the West and the Iron Throne, securing the independence of the North and the Trident. Lately I have been reading more and more of his exploits and am becoming intrigued by his pursuit of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.16;Strategy is fascinating maybe I should study it more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.16;Interesting as this is, I have more pressing matters to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.17;Not for nothing is the castle of the Boltons called the Dreadfort – many of my ancestors have been known for their cruel and inventive methods of torturing others: it is said that skinning their foes was just the start for men like King Robar Redarm. Should I seek to follow their example, or should I chart my own course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.17;Others deserve to know pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.17;I am not my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.18;The Starks are known as an honourable and just lot – it is said the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. As men like Cregan Stark showed justice is not always the same thing as leniency and it is a hard path to walk. Should I follow my Stark Blood or are these views antiquated and pointless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.18;Justice has its merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.18;The need for flexibility outweighs the need for justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.19;The old blood of the First Men or even the giants themselves must surely flow very strongly in your veins! It would appear that though it did not manifest itself at birth, you have a natural predisposition towards a tall and imposing stature that is now clear to see for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.19;I have become rather tall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.20;The old blood of the First Men must surely flow very strongly in your veins! Houses with strong First Men ancestry such as the Royces, Umbers, Crakehalls, Mormonts, Durrandons, and Strongs are all known to often tend towards great strength. It would appear that though it did not manifest itself at birth, you have a natural predisposition towards a strong and robust physique!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.20;I have become rather strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.21;Many of your ancestors were legendary warriors, renowned for bravery and courage. Inspired by their example you constantly strive to prove yourself through acts of valour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.21;I lead from the front!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.22;Family, Duty, Honour – these are the words of House Tully. As a bearer of the Tully bloodline many will expect you to live by these values too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.22;These are words to live by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.22;What a load of nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.23;A number of your ancestors acquired reputations for piety, conviction, and religious belief. Should you follow in their example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.23;Become Zealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.23;Too much piety can be a bad thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.24;The other Ironborn call the members of House Codd craven cowards who fight in underhanded ways that would shame any true Ironborn. As I bear the blood of House Codd that reputation brings shame on me, what should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.24;I may be craven, but they will be dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.24;Ironborn do not flee from a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.25;It is said that since Rose of Red Lake herself the women of House Crane have had the ability to transform themselves into a crane at will.

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.25;Shoo, you pesky bird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.26;I shall harness flame as my servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.26;Aerys was a madman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.27;Morgon Banefort, the last Banefort King, cursed his Lannister enemies before they put him to death. Soon after the lions of Casterly Rock broke free slaying three of Loreon Lannister’s sons.

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.28;I am no beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.29;You bear the blood of the Karstarks, who have held lands just south of the Wall since Karlon Stark put down a rebel lord. The constant threat of wildling raids and the precariousness of life that far north meant that the Karstarks had to become tough and fierce, with a lifestyle that predisposed them to being strong enough to deal with everything life threw at them, as a result you have obtained a strong and robust physique that is now clear to see for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.29;I have become rather strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.30;You bear the blood of legendary poets and renowned bard, and music and song have always held an appeal for you. Do you embrace the calling of your ancestors and become a committed poet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.30;I must get myself a lute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.30;There are better uses of my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.40;I bear the blood of one who achieved what few skinchangers can and became master of many different beasts.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.64;Last night I had a green dream where I was seeing through the eyes of trees and hearing on the ears of the wind when I saw shadow figures speaking in hushed tones. As the Old Gods gradually revealed to me their faces, I was able to hear some most concerning plans that they were plotting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.64;Their plot is revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.70;My ancestor King Daeron the Young Dragon was a skilled tactician who whilst little more than a child smashed the armies of the Martells, conquering Dorne, a feat not even Aegon the Conqueror could achieve. Lately I have been reading more and more of his exploits and am becoming intrigued by his pursuit of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.70;Strategy is fascinating maybe I should study it more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.70;Interesting as this is, I have more pressing matters to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.71;My Bloodline has long been associated with faith, piety, and devotion to the Gods. Perhaps I should emphasise my dedication and take a vow of celibacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.71;I shall ignore the appetites of the flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.71;Maybe that's going a little too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.72;King Baelor was a model of piety and faith, perhaps I should follow in his footsteps and live my life in the fullness of faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.72;Piety is the mark of the righteous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.72;Baelor was blessed, but his mind was addled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.73;King Baelor was a model of piety and faith and claimed that the Seven spoke to him, and gave him commands. Could these voices... could they truly be the Seven? Do they speak through me too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.73;Behold I am also blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.73;No, I do not hear the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.74;Long has it said that those with the Farwynd blood are blessed by the Drowned God, with a connection to the beasts of the sea: I have long had vivid dreams of swimming in the cold deep ocean, now a sea lion has come ashore. Strangely docile it seems to be seeking me out, almost as if it recognises me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.74;I am a skinchanger, and I claim the sea lion as my second skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.74;I am no beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.75;Long has it said that those with the Farwynd blood are blessed by the Drowned God, with a connection to the beasts of the sea: I have long had vivid dreams of swimming in the cold deep ocean, now a mighty leviathon has come to swim aside my ship. Strangely docile it seems to be seeking me out, almost as if it recognises me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.77;You bear the blood of many a legendary warriors, renowned for their skill in personal combat, and the chance to test yourself in combat has always appealed to you. Do you embrace the calling of your ancestors and become a committed duelist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.77;Personal combat is in my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.77;Dueling bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.78;Your ancestors have a reputation for formality and honourable behaviour. Perhaps you should strive to embody such noble values in your own life, honouring their example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.78;Such behaviour is the right way to lead my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.78;What a load of rubbish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.79;When I was growing up my nurse would often tell me that those who bore the Westford blood bore the blood of First Men, sometimes able to wear the skins of beasts, I always thought them childish tales, but today I encountered a large wild dog as I was out riding, it eyes seeming to peer into my very soul. Strangely docile it seems to be seeking me out and followed me all the way back to the stables, almost as if it recognises me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.79;I am a skinchanger, and I claim the dog as my second skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.79;I am no beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.900;You have been feeling increasingly on edge of late, hearing others whisper about you in corners, plotting against you, threatening you and all you hold dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.900;Well everyone IS out to get me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.81;I dreamt I was flying, that a crow came to me and opened my third eye, that I looked deep into the heart of winter, that I saw through the eyes of weirwoods, seeing the past present and future, seeing the very truth that lies beneath the world. When I awoke I knew I was chosen by the Old Gods, that I am a greenseer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.82;I have been having vivid dreams of late, dreams of the leaf and stone, dreams of what is past and what may yet be to come. Could these dreams have meaning? Could these dreams be messages from the Old Gods themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.83;In my dreams I had a vision of an ancient being, seated on a throne of weirwood, they told me they are a greenseer and here to teach me the secrets of the Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.83;I will learn from them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.83;I will not trouble myself with this knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.84;After many vivid dreams, pushing my mind into those of beasts and trees, and consuming paste made from weirwood seed, I have at last mastered the knowledge of a true greenseer and my master has passed on their mantle to me. Now, if they wish, they may die in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.86;I have taught the new greenseer many secrets of the truth that lies beneath the world and the ways of the Old Gods, now I have nothing left to teach and they are a fully fledged greenseer. Now if I wish I may finally cast off my failing body and become one with the Old Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.86;I have taught the new greenseer many secrets of the truth that lies beneath the world and the ways of the Old Gods, now I have nothing left to teach and they are a fully fledged greenseer.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.8601;I had taught my student much, however it seems that the Old Gods needed them more than I, and they have died, becoming one with the weirwoods. I must wait for a new student to emerge before I can finally accept my own death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.87;The Greenseer who taught me the ways of the Old Gods has decided to become one with the trees, leaving his body and weirwood throne behind, I now must take up his mantle and guide the Children of the Forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.98;During my training and meditation with the Elder in the forest glade I felt my mind begin to forge a strong new connection with a new animal. In time I came to realise I had acquired a new skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.98;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.99;I have come to realise that the Gods I once followed were false idols, and that true power rests with the Old Gods of the First Men and Children of the Forest. The Gods of tree and stone, of stream and wind. From this day forward I will worship only them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.346A;You spent time listening to the minds of animals as they fought with each other, to better understand how to channel your rage and defeat your enemies, but it seems all they did was warp your mind, making you angry and frustrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.346B;Your reflections on magic were certainly interesting, but they severely affected your mind, leaving it addled and confused..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.346C;For hours and hours I pondered the secrets of others, seeking them out through beast and tree. But wait, what if someone seeks to do the same for my secrets?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.346A;Arghhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.346B;Eh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.346C;This is maddening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.347A;You spent many days studying the minds of beasts, and the time was spent very productively. You find your body surging with an energy you never knew you had, you feel you could take on any foe, and your mind is full of images of combat. You feel a particularly intense connection with the bears of the forest and you channel their power through your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.347B;You spent many days pondering the nature of magic and the role of the Old Gods, and the time was spent very productively. You find mind crackling with a power you never knew you could wield, it seems you could control an entire forest at once! Whilst your mind is abuzz with this knowledge you carve a staff from a branch of weirwood and engrave it with the runes of the First Men, inscribing it with power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.347C;You spent many days listening for secrets on the wind, seeing the past through dreams and the eyes of trees, and wearing the skins of small creatures to evesdrop on others. In the process you gain an innate understanding of manipulation and subterfuge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.362;You prepare yourself a secluded spot in a glade not far from [Root.Capital.GetName]. You seek out a solitary weirwood and cut yourself one of its sturdier branches, before settling down to carve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.362;I begin to ponder all I know of the runes of the First Men;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIPmore_bloodlines.362;You begin to carve the branch into a staff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.363;You spent many days working the branch into a staff of office, and the time was spent very productively. You find the appropriate runes spring to your mind with the slightest thought, and soon the staff is carved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.363;I have learnt much in this process;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.364;You spent many days carving the staff. In the end it is done and inscribed with those runes you deem appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.364;I will crush my enemies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.365;Despite a lengthy period in seclusion carving the staff you achieved little. The runes seemed nothing more than incoherent scratchings on the branch, and on the last day you pressed too deep with the knife and snapped the branch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.450;We Blackwoods have kept the Old Gods, praying at the great raven filled weirwood that gives our keep its name.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.600;One of the largest settlements in the North, Barrowton has been ruled by House Dustin, descendants of the ancient Barrow Kings, since time imemorial. After the death of Lord Willam Dustin in service of Winterfell, it was decided that his widow, Lady Barbrey, daughter of the Lord of the Rills, would rule Barrowton.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.800;With the offspring of Cersei Lannister having been revealed as bastards born of foul incest with her brother, the line of House Baratheon seemed threatened.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.803;A group of guardsmen accost you on the street and take you to a darkened room where hooded figure is wreathed in shadow.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.804;As you go about your business in [Root.Location.GetName] you see an individual who bears a shocking relationship to Robert Baratheon!

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.805;Now that you are victorious and the true parentage of the Lannisters is now known to all, House Baratheon teeters on the brink of extinction.

EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.2;The Basilisk of Gogossos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.2;The Isle of Tears was once the site of a great city founded by the Ghiscari and captured by the Valyrian Freehold during the Third Ghiscari War who renamed it Gogossos. The dragonlords used it as a penal colony for the worst criminals. New methods of torture were used and blood magic is said to have been practiced on the Isle. Gogossos grew powerful through slavery and sorcery during the Century of Blood, with some calling it the "Tenth Free City", until the Red Death brought ruin to the Basilisk Islands.\nNow only ruins remain as you begin your reconstruction. Beneath an ancient temple to the Valyrian Gods your builders have found a strange room carved in Valyrian glyphs and with a life sized stone basilisk with a gaping open mouth in the centre. One who speaks Old High Valyrian tells you they speak of a sacrificial ritual and a great reward for those who will grant the basilisk the blood it craves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_valyrian_quest.2;I will do what I must, have one of the [Root.GetPeasantNamePlural] bound and brought here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.3;The prisoner is place with their head in the mouth of the stone basilisk as the glyphs instruct, suddenly the jaws slam shut, removing the man's head in a single stroke. As his blood drains from his body a section of wall lifts up revealing a secret room full of treasures, and, greatest of all a Valyrian Steel blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.4;You puzzle over the glyphs, it seems this was a sacrificial chamber used by the Gogossans to conduct their cruel flesh-changing rituals. After several hours you feel ready to circumvent the spells and with great exertion you bind the powers of this place to yourself. As you do a section of wall lifts up revealing a secret room full of treasures, and, greatest of all a Valyrian Steel blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.5;The Chimera of Valyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.5;The City of Monsters Mantarys at the northern tip of the Sea of Sighs was one of the many cities founded by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and its deformed inhabitants remember more of Valyria than most.\nNow that you have reunited the Lands of Valyria once more a group of twisted Mantyran priests come to you, acclaiming you as true heir to the Freehold. They bring you an ancient Valyrian Steel greatsword that they have held as a sacred relic since before the Doom and offer to teach you the secrets of their order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now that the forests are being settled once more a strange group of these Ifquevron have come to your court asking for an audience with you. The creatures speak your tongue with a strange, alien accent and offer you a bargain, if you will pledge them gifts of leaf, stone, and water, and make your subjects honour the forests and sacred trees signing a pact for yourself and your successors, they will teach you ancient secrets and give you mighty gifts they obtained from ancient men who "rode upon the very sky itself".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.7;The Crown and the Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.7;[From.GetName] was once the site of a great castle, overlooking the Narrow Sea. In Kin of the Stag Maester Hubert claims that it was built by Andals and was the seat of petty kings who were eventually brought to heal by the Storm Kings. Almost all of the castle was in ruins when you started the rebuilding, piles of fallen stone everywhere and overgrown with ivy. One day whilst clearing some rubble your builders found a passageway leading below ground to a set of catacombs with grand tombs and carved sephulchres of the ancient kings, and within them many chests filled with ancient gold and coins! They have even found what must be the Royal crown, and, lying on a the tomb engraved with the image of a mighty knight, a strange sword with a pale blade, amazingly sharp, unblemished by the centuries. The workers whisper that it is Just Maid, the blade of Ser Galladon of Morne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_theon_notification.1;News from [From.Capital.GetName] [Root.GetTitledFirstName], it seems that after being forced to choose between his true family and his foster family Prince Theon Greyjoy of the Iron Isles has chosen to betray his House. It seems that after being ordered by his father, Iron King Balon Greyjoy, to harry the Stony Shore Theon decided to defect. Feigning loyalty to his father he sailed his longship North, before deliberately leading his own men into a Northman ambush. Some of his crew, including his squire Wex Pyke, chose to defect to King Robb Stark, the rest were executed. Now Prince Theon has once again pledged his sword and ship to the Starks and has declared his father Balon a fool and a madman for seeking war with Winterfell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTtitlembs_theon_notification.2;Theon Turncloak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_theon_notification.2;It seems that it is as I feared. The green lands have made my son soft, and the Starks have made him theirs. After pledging me his loyalty and taking his longship North with the Damphair and the Cleftjaw to harry the Stony Shore, Theon separated from the main force, taking the crews of two longships further inland, only to purposefully lead them into a Northman ambush. Announcing that his loyalties lay with that pup Robb Stark, Theon bade his crew follow him in turning their cloaks which some shamefully did including his squire Wex Pyke, the rest were executed by the Northmen. Now Theon calls me a fool and a madman, and has offered the Starks his sword and his ship in service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Thankfully, he chose friendship and honour over his deceitful kin. Pretending to agree to his father's orders he sailed his longship the 'Sea Bitch' north to the Stony Shore. Once there he separated from the main force, and led the crews of two longships further inland, before departing alone to scout ahead, whereupon he contacted Northern scouts and arranged an ambush. Suspecting nothing the Ironborn raiders were captured to a man. Some, including Theon's squire, agreed to pledge their loyalty to Winterfell, the rest were executed. Now Theon fights by my side once more, having proven his loyalty beyond question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
