ca_winterfell_throne;Direwolf Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_winterfell_throne_desc;The high seat of House Stark, where the Lords of Winterfell have sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings of Winter. The seat is cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms and  the carved heads of direwolves snarl on the ends of its massive arms. Though not as opulent as other thrones of Westeros, the high seat represents the power of the Lords of Winterfell and the legacy of House Stark, stretching back to the Age of Heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_iron_throne;The Iron Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_iron_throne_desc;The Iron Throne is the seat of the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, built on the orders of Aegon I after his Conquest. It is a cold, hard and imposing seat, made from the swords of those defeated by Aegon and his sisters. The thousand blades used to forge the throne were heated by the flames of Balerion the Black Dread and hammered for fifty-nine days. It is uncomfortable, and the back is fanged with steel which makes leaning back impossible. Aegon I had it made this way deliberately, saying that a king should never sit easy. Indeed it is said that the throne may even chose to reject those that sit upon them, cutting them with one of the many jagged blades used in its construction. Only the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and his Hand may sit the throne and when the king is presiding, only he, his family, and his council may sit; all others must stand or kneel. When the King is seated atop the Iron Throne, with his Kingsguard standing below it, he radiates power and authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_valyria_throne;The Throne of Valyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_valyria_throne_desc;The Throne of Valyria is the high seat of the Dragon Lords of The New Valyria. According to legend, the imposing throne was made from the valyrian swords of those who perished in the Doom with the dragon blood using old magics of the high priests of Mantarys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_driftwood_throne;The Driftwood Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_driftwood_throne_desc;The Driftfwood Throne is the high seat of the Velaryon Lords of Driftmark. According to legend, the throne was given by the Merling King as part of a pact with the Velaryons. Tracing their heritage back to Old Valyria, the Velaryons are a prestigious house. Though their holdings are small, their strategic position enables them to control Blackwater Bay and much of the Narrow Sea, as well as the trade that flows through them, this has made them rich and powerful, with many recognising the power of the Lord of the Tides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_seastone_throne;The Seastone Chair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_seastone_throne_desc;The Steastone Chair is the ancient throne of the Iron Islands, made of a block of oily black stone carved into the shape of a kraken. Legend says it was found on the shores of Old Wyk by First Men when they came to the Iron Islands. Amongst the more devout followers of the Drowned God it is said that only a pious ironborn man may sit the Seastone Chair. The strange black stone throne represents the power and right to rule those that sit it have over the Iron Isles, and carries with it considerable prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_eyrie_throne;The Carved Throne of the Eyrie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_eyrie_throne_desc;The Arryn Lords of the Vale have long sat on a large throne carved from weirwood, the same white colour as the snows that carpet the Giant's Lance. As weirwood does not rot, the throne could easily date back millenia to the construction of the Eyrie itself. With the Vale the first Westerosi Kingdom conquered by the Andals, the use of a throne carved from the sacred wood of a heart tree may have been a pointed move by House Arryn to emphasise that the Faith of the Seven, not the Old Gods, would hold sway over their lands, but who can now say for certain. What is known is that the Lord of the Eyrie wields immense power and deserves respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_golden_gallery;The Golden Gallery and The Hall of Heroes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_golden_gallery_desc;The seat of House Lannister since the Age of Heroes and built atop the greatest known gold mines in Westeros, Casterly Rock is home to many great treasures. The greatest of these are to be found in the immense caverns known as the Golden Gallery and the Hall of Heroes. The Gallery is famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms for the magnificence of the treasures and gilded ornaments that line its walls. The Hall of Heroes is where the Lannisters and their relatives are buried and the costly armor worn by a hundred Lannister knights, lords, and kings stand eternal guard. The magnificence of these rooms is unmatched in Westeros and reinforces the power and prestige of those that rule Caterly Rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At the heart of the room are two seats on a dais, near twin to one another, save that one has the Martell spear inlaid in gold upon its back, whilst the other bears the blazing Rhoynish sun that had flown from the masts of Nymeria's ships when first they came to Dorne.\n\nThese twin thrones are a powerful symbol of the achievements of the Nymeros-Martell Princes of Dorne, as well as a not so subtle reminder that in Dorne a woman stands equal to a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_oaken_throne_1_desc;For centuries the Gardener Kings of the Reach ruled from the Oakenseat, a living throne grown from an oak planted at the centre of Highgarden by Garth Greenhand himself.
